# Task:
The comments that you are given are a patient describing their visit at a hospital.
Label the patient feedback data based on the different fields.
If there is no context for the field, return 'unknown' for the field.
Because the comments are anonymized, [person_name] represents an identify name that has been anonymized.
If the comment is '(BLANK)', '(INAUDIBLE)' or '(unreadable)', just label 'unknown' for all categories unless you can extract meaningful statements.
If the comment appears incomplete or a fragment, just label 'unknown' for all categories unless you can extract meaningful statements.
Consider the sentiment of the patient feedback before labeling.
Return only the label structure as follows:

<|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Patient Feedback: My biggest concern during my visit to the emergency room, I felt I got good care.  However I was as having spent 20 years in the health care field working in an outpatient clinic of a hospital, I was very concerned about HIPAA.  There was a gentleman outside the cubicle I was in, the curtain was not pulled for the curtain that I was in.  I could see what was happening, the care that this gentleman was receiving.  I could see the staff talking about what had happened to him, why he was receiving the care that he was getting.  He was not in a cubicle, just out in the hallway outside my cubicle.  The other concern I had and I did not realize it, I didn't stop to look until after I was too far by, was when my husband and I were leaving the emergency room, we walked by*

<|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Patient Feedback: I was with my 84 year old dad who was there after a fall in his memory care facility. I am POA.  The doctors were both great, and the nurse that came on at 7pm 2/20 was great. However the nurse we had for the majority of the day, [person_name], was the worst  medical person I have encountered in my dad's entire journey with dementia. It was like she had never worked with elderly patients, especially dementia patients.  At one point I left the room to get food, and when I returned my dad was sitting up at the end of the bad trying to stand up. I pressed the call button for help and [person_name] came in and immediately was yelling at my dad.  Later she was trying to get my dad to take a pill and he was having trouble swallowing it, and again she was yelling at him to swallow it, and to open his mouth. at one point she grabbed his chin.  He was frustrated and confused (like any dementia pt would have been) and trying to take the cup and hold it himself and she scolded him for that too. He had not eaten anything all day, and around 5 I asked if I could give him some yogurt and she said she'd check with the doctor, and never got back to me about that. ..I was also surprised there was no bed alarm despite his fall risk bracelet, and I was not there when he came by ambulance, so when he was brought to that room they did not know someone would be in there with him. Had I not returned when I did to find him sitting on the end of the bed, he would fallen again for sure.

Things seemed unsanitary. Put in a shared room even though I was supposed to be in single room due to my illness. 2nd shift nurses were very professional and cleaned the mess that was left behind.

<|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Patient Feedback: It was absolutely the dirtiest emergency room that I have ever seen. The front desk people were on their phones the entire time I had to say excuse me the dirtiest emergency room that I have ever seen. The front desk people were on their phones the entire time I had to say excuse me 3 times to get their attention. The place was not cleaned. I had to get paper towels and hand sanitizer to wipe the area. We were sitting at down because there were dirty tissues on the floor. No toilet paper in the restrooms. The restrooms were worse than the county jail. As a nurse that has worked in the medical field for years I was absolutely terrified of what germs could affect my child with an autoimmune disease. We waited for 8 hours and no one offered us any water, blankets, or pillows even after we were back in a room. My daughter was processed as an acuity 2. I had tried to purchase water from the vending machines, but there was none available. I did buy two drinks but what my daughter needed was water, and that was never offered even after we made a comment. We chose not to be admitted because we would've had to stay in the emergency room until well after her specialist opened and it was too dirty and nasty and unaccommodating for us to be there so we opted to go home. The only positive thing I can say, is that the doctors communicated with us and each other amazingly.

<|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Patient Feedback: I had been running a fever, so my cancer doctor advised me to go to the ER for bloodwork.  I arrived there about 12:45PM.  The wait was endless.  All the nurses and hospital workers were outstanding.  Due to the cancer, throughout the day I would have bouts of pain.  One time the pain got rather severe.  But I had to sit hour upon hour uncomfortably in the chair.  They finally did the needed blood work around 6PM, I think.  We got the results of the bloodwork via My [person_name] around 7:30 or so.  My daughter is a [person_name] [person_name] and read the report and said there was no indication of any problem with the bloodwork.  So, after sitting in the ER for 9 hours, we decided to leave.  [person_name] realize that the hospitals are way understaffed and the beds are full.  However, something needs to be done to improve this situation...Some, if not all, of the questions should have a "not applicable" choice.  I was forced to answer some questions with a "no" answer because I couldn't choose "not applicable ".  An example is one question asked about the doctor I saw.  After 9 hours of waiting, we left without seeing a doctor.  I probably answered 4 or 5 questions with a no response because I couldn't choose NA.

<|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Patient Feedback: Everyone was pleasant from entrance in [person_name] & all staff until I was told by last lady in room. She said you can leave, I had to ask another staff member to call her back into room. I couldn't leave because I was hooked up to all the monitors and my finger was still connected to device that was taped. As young lady went to get the young lady. She came in room and said I was told I had a tone with you, & I said that was not the case, I'm hooked up to all this stuff after you told me I could leave. She was very fast talking, and rushing in a manner that made me feel uncomfortable. However the 2 ladies at waiting room admission was nice, nurse in my room was kind, insurance worker was kind, and make [person_name] was very humble and nice. Just the one lady that discharged me in that unprofessional manner was disturbing.
