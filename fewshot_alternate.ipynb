The concrete supplier is a concrete plant which had a section of the yard that stockpiles used concrete for recycling. It is at this area of the yard, where used concrete is recycled into stone. The crew consisted of Employee #1, a plant (Horizontal Shaft Impactor) excavator, and Employee #2. Employee #1 and Employee #2 had worked approximately three weeks at the concrete supplier with no supervision or no association with the management. Employee #1 and Employee #2 had a problem with the equipment they were to call the management who would send either a mechanic or field supervisor to the site. Employee #2 broke up the used or excess concrete stored at concrete supplier and loaded the concrete with the use of the excavator onto the impactor's running conveyor belt. Employee #1 with the use of a hand control would remotely run the impactor, so that the impactor would further break up the broken concrete into the required size of rock.  Employee #1 operating the impactor ran the load of broken concrete through the impactor and at some time shut the impactor down. After shutting down the impactor, Employee #1 climbed up onto the impactor and unscrewed the locking bolts of the impactor's rear shell door and opened the impactor's rear clam shell door by the impactor's controls. After Employee #1 opened the chamber's rear door, Employee #1 locked and tagged out the operating panel of the impactor. After locking out the operating panel, Employee #1 entered the impactor's chamber to service or un-jam large rocks from the aprons of the impactor. As Employee #1 stood in the chamber of the impactor, the hydraulic line broke away from the impactor's hydraulic main access cylinder allowing hydraulic fluid to spray out of the cylinder and the line resulting in the cylinder to lose fluid pressure and the impactor's rear door to move forward to the chamber's closed position striking Employee #1 in the upper body and head.  Employee #2 with a new load of broken concrete returned to the impactor and noticed the impactor was shut down. Employee #2 got off the excavator walked around the impactor and seeing hydraulic fluid sprayed over the side of the impactor looked up and saw Employee #1 inside the chamber of the impactor pinned between the rear door and the frame of the impactor. Employee #2 left the impactor and found an employee of concrete supplier who called 911.  The Fire Department arrived on the site, and attended to Employee #1. Employee #1 was pronounced dead. \n",

The employee walked to the far end of the log and attached a tape measure and walked back. The employee returned, fell approximately 49 inches through an opening in the decking, and landed on a hydraulic cylinder which moves a metal push bar causing logs to move to the deck conveyors from the small bull chain.

The platforms were not fully decked, leaving three floor openings on either side of the small bull chain conveyor. The openings between the chains that were not decked were approximately 40 inches by 50 inches.

The employee had started to cut a welded metal piece from the rear of the electrode arm to return the LMS to service. The metal piece detached from the arm and gravity brought the arm to its resting position approximately 4-8 feet below. The arm came down and struck the employee on the head.

The pallets were located in the Bagging Area of the Peterbilt Road Striping Truck, Vehicle Identification Number (VIN): 3BPZXJEX8EF241456; Thermoplastic Striping Pump:  Model Number:  4 - 16000 - AD -G; Serial Number:  13417.  This area was located between the truck cab and the kettles (melter tanks) feet and used to store extra bags of thermoplastic. The dimension of this area was approximately 65 feet long by 96 feet wide and 55.5 feet from ground.  The accident occurred in a traffic circle leading under an overpass.  Employee #1 was tasked to feed bags of thermoplastic powder into the melter. The melter was a tank that heated the thermoplastic material into a liquid. The employer was contracted to repaint traffic lines onto the roadway in a county.  The team members prepared their equipment at a nearby convenience store which was approximately 1/2 mile away from their work zone.  The crew leader instructed the members to load up and head out.  The team included a four vehicle convoy.  The crew leader drove the road striping truck with an operator sitting in the operator's seat located at the rear of the truck.  Employee #1 was located in the Bagging Area. When the convoy departed the convenience store parking lot, the road striping truck lead the convoy with Employee #1 standing on top of the pallets and placing him approximately 114.5 feet above the ground.  The road striping truck entered the circle and headed towards the overpass which was approximately 192 feet above the ground.  As the road striping truck approached the overpass, Employee #1 was facing the rear of the vehicle.  When the road striping truck drove under the overpass, the back of Employee #1's head struck against the side of the overpass.  At this moment, the remaining vehicles in the convoy never entered the traffic circle due to the high volume of traffic.  Employee #1 sustained head trauma and second degree burns to both hands and was hospitalized.  On April 24, 2017 at about 4:30p.m. Employee #1 passed away. Employee #1 did not use the passenger seat in the cab or the operator's seat located at the rear of the truck.  Employees overfilled the bagging area with six pallets of thermoplastic bags.  This condition did not allow Employee #1 use of one of the two fold down platforms measuring approximately 38.5 feet long by 18.5 feet wide. \n",

During the maintenance, the loader was elevated to an approximate height of 21 inches using jack stands. The bucket was facing down and was off the ground. However, the cab of the loader was removed and sitting on the ground next to the machine. Electrical power that had been running from the cab to the machine so controls would operate remained in place during inspection.  As the employee was checking the hydraulic lines, a vibration occurred and caused the joystick that controlled the bucket to shift. The bucket fell toward the ground and lifted the loader back end. The employee jumped up on the final drive of the loader to reach the joystick in an attempt to lift the bucket, which resulted in the loader falling to the ground. The employee fell about 4 feet and hit his chest and abdomen on the machine. The employee was hospitalized and received treatment for his injuries that included a torn bowel. \n",
