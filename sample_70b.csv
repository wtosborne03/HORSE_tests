17,"""Unprofessional"" The registration lady called out a portion of my personal information in the hallway which was crowded with patients.  I asked her not to verify my personal information [person_name]#, dob, address where others could hear it.  She said I would have to wait for a room and they were all filled.  So she pointed to the information on the screen while the patient in the bed behind me visitor viewed my information on the computer screen.  Nothing about this protects my privacy, made me feel safe or cared about while under your system.  I was mortified.  In addition, I waited more than three hours and the doctor did not address the pain I was having in my knees.  I had to make a separate appointment w/pc to have checked.  I feel sorry for [person_name]'s patients and staff as they were clearly overwhelmed and under staffed.  In fact no one asked about my pain level.  I only use the emergency room as a last resort.  The doctor hurriedly evaluated me wrote prescriptions and didn't even request a wheelchair so my husband could roll me out.  I was in car wreck injuries to my neck, low back, knees, w/headache.  I will say while I waited in pain I had the displeasure of hearing the nurses at the nurse station have a profanity war.  The f-bomb was dropped several times.  What the f@$) is this, this is not f@&$ing fair, why am I getting all the EMS calls, why are they letting all these f@&$ nurses go home;  when they were not cussing, they were watching videos with [person_name]the hallways were lined with patients and they were more concerned w/their entertainment.  And I hope there is a discounted rate for the services provided because I never made it to a room.  I spent hours in a hallway where not one person asked about my pain level and more importantly I don't think I was fairly evaluated in a hall way full of people.  This was my worse experience at your establishment.  The entire time I felt violated like, can I show him the bruise from the seat belt, then the whole hallway will see, will someone try to steal my information, my identity, who's listen to my complaints, can I trust these people, and establishment, [person_name] surely this not part of protecting patients and their privacy.  My entire time w/the doctor was rushed, I waited over three hours after my x-ray and I feel like all my concerns were not addressed properly, or brushed off. , or just not enough time or importance to deal with.  I want to be fair in my assessment I think my doctor did a good job assessing my neck injury possibly the most important thing but nothing about my knee injury or low back.  So now I have to create another bill to address my swollen knees...Upside I was x-rayed within an hour of my visit and the young lady [person_name] was patient, kind, and helpful.  My nurse [person_name] was awesome caring and prompt as well. [person_name] was also very helpful during my visit.  Some of your Staff are excellent caregivers while others just can't be bothered.  They spend more time on their phones than working.  The three young ladies I mentioned above I would rate 10/10 and [person_name] [person_name]. Solid 8/10.  Only so much you can do when you have 5 minutes or less to see a patient. I also need to mention the triage team at check-in [person_name] [person_name] 10/10.

Medication was not given until I went to the back and that was around 1 AM and around that time the pain has stopped.

I was left in a room for 2.5 hours with my son without any explanation and was not told that the doctor was in trauma until I went to the nurses station. Once it got to be 9:45pm and there was no doctor or nurse in sight I had to make the decision to leave because 1) I have a job that I have to get to the next morning 2) my son was jumping off the walls from waiting for 5 hours 3) my son had not ate since 3:45 when we got there because he ""might"" need test per the triage nurse 4) the nurse finally come to tell me that the resident doctor was in trauma and did not know when they would get out and 3 people were in front of my child. Your emergency room is far from efficient in the way they check people in and see them i.e people were being called by triage nurse and registration person at the same time and then people were being called multiple times when it was clear they had left the facility. Also, there was NO social distancing at all because of how crowded the waiting room was.

I would talk to her and say thank you and she never would respond and answer me. I then realized from what I could hear around me, other patience were not being nice. So I just kept praising her about the job she was doing for so many and thanked her again. This softened the tension she was setting off. Before I went to get a [person_name] there was a young blond headed girl taking my blood. As she was pushing the tube in to draw the blood she kept pushing on the IV and causing pain. I didn't understand why since there is the extension piece that is there and no need for me to feel the IV needle pushing back and forth in my arm. I asked her why she was doing that and that she was hurting me and she just said; YOUR FINE! As I was being taken off of the CT machine table and back on the bed, I believe it was a young man with reddish hair that was on the right side of me. As he was putting the sheet back onto the bed from the right side, from the left the sheet came over my face covering my whole face. I was saying; please, I can not breath and was trying to pull it off but it was hooked on my neck brace. He still just kept hooking the top right side of the bed never removing the sheet from my face. A darker haired woman that was on the left side kept saying to him, the sheets over her face and then when he still didn't remove it, she reached over snd helped me remove it and kept it at least off my face until he put it on the bed itself. my body was still in shock from the injury and I could not stop shaking. As I asked for another blanket to warm me up he told me I didn't need any more since I already had 3 and that I could have hyperthermia and he couldn't give me another one. I don't know who the woman was in the room, but she brought me another one that was a warm blanket and was the only one that was kind with her words of comfort and actions as she covered me saying and telling me even how cold I was and that this heated blanket will help. I lost a lot of blood that night from my head injury. I have had many surgeries and ER visits through the years for different health issues and have always bragged about the care that the [person_name] health system had. After this night and the care I received at [person_name], I pray I never have to come there again or any one in my family. The young person that drew my blood and the runner that took to to and from the [person_name], should not be in a hospital setting!

Communication with either through the nurse was almost non-existent, and actually required me flagging one of them down occasionally as they passed by the corner room that I was in. The lack of communication was not their fault, and they appeared extremely calm and professional as a team throughout the most hectic of times. I never received the name of my nurse. In fact, I called out as someone passed my door about 50 minutes after shift change to ask if the previous nurses who started my IV had gone for the day, to which she replied, ""I'm your nurse now. What do you need?"" No further introduction or questions were asked by her for roughly 5 hours, and except for a few rounds of meds, the only communication we had was in the form of her telling me to sit down and to not rip my IV out. I previously worked in the emergency department of a nearby level 3 trauma center, so I am no stranger to how all of it works. Summarily, I felt ignored by the nurse, and that my few questions irritated her to the point where she would forget to relay any message, questions, or requests to the doctors, whether intentionally or not. Again, I give a 10/10 to both [person_name] [person_name] and [person_name] [person_name], but due to the non-existent communication, and overall extremely poor experience as compared to other recent visits, I'd rate this as a 1.
