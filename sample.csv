17,"""Unprofessional"" The registration lady called out a portion of my personal information in the hallway which was crowded with patients.  I asked her not to verify my personal information [person_name]#, dob, address where others could hear it.  She said I would have to wait for a room and they were all filled.  So she pointed to the information on the screen while the patient in the bed behind me visitor viewed my information on the computer screen.  Nothing about this protects my privacy, made me feel safe or cared about while under your system.  I was mortified.  In addition, I waited more than three hours and the doctor did not address the pain I was having in my knees.  I had to make a separate appointment w/pc to have checked.  I feel sorry for [person_name]'s patients and staff as they were clearly overwhelmed and under staffed.  In fact no one asked about my pain level.  I only use the emergency room as a last resort.  The doctor hurriedly evaluated me wrote prescriptions and didn't even request a wheelchair so my husband could roll me out.  I was in car wreck injuries to my neck, low back, knees, w/headache.  I will say while I waited in pain I had the displeasure of hearing the nurses at the nurse station have a profanity war.  The f-bomb was dropped several times.  What the f@$) is this, this is not f@&$ing fair, why am I getting all the EMS calls, why are they letting all these f@&$ nurses go home;  when they were not cussing, they were watching videos with [person_name]the hallways were lined with patients and they were more concerned w/their entertainment.  And I hope there is a discounted rate for the services provided because I never made it to a room.  I spent hours in a hallway where not one person asked about my pain level and more importantly I don't think I was fairly evaluated in a hall way full of people.  This was my worse experience at your establishment.  The entire time I felt violated like, can I show him the bruise from the seat belt, then the whole hallway will see, will someone try to steal my information, my identity, who's listen to my complaints, can I trust these people, and establishment, [person_name] surely this not part of protecting patients and their privacy.  My entire time w/the doctor was rushed, I waited over three hours after my x-ray and I feel like all my concerns were not addressed properly, or brushed off. , or just not enough time or importance to deal with.  I want to be fair in my assessment I think my doctor did a good job assessing my neck injury possibly the most important thing but nothing about my knee injury or low back.  So now I have to create another bill to address my swollen knees...Upside I was x-rayed within an hour of my visit and the young lady [person_name] was patient, kind, and helpful.  My nurse [person_name] was awesome caring and prompt as well. [person_name] was also very helpful during my visit.  Some of your Staff are excellent caregivers while others just can't be bothered.

Your emergency room is far from efficient in the way they check people in and see them i.e people were being called by triage nurse and registration person at the same time and then people were being called multiple times when it was clear they had left the facility. Also, there was NO social distancing at all because of how crowded the waiting room was.

I would talk to her and say thank you and she never would respond and answer me. I then realized from what I could hear around me, other patience were not being nice. So I just kept praising her about the job she was doing for so many and thanked her again. This softened the tension she was setting off. Before I went to get a [person_name] there was a young blond headed girl taking my blood. As she was pushing the tube in to draw the blood she kept pushing on the IV and causing pain. I didn't understand why since there is the extension piece that is there and no need for me to feel the IV needle pushing back and forth in my arm. I asked her why she was doing that and that she was hurting me and she just said; YOUR FINE! As I was being taken off of the CT machine table and back on the bed, I believe it was a young man with reddish hair that was on the right side of me. As he was putting the sheet back onto the bed from the right side, from the left the sheet came over my face covering my whole face. I was saying; please, I can not breath and was trying to pull it off but it was hooked on my neck brace. He still just kept hooking the top right side of the bed never removing the sheet from my face. A darker haired woman that was on the left side kept saying to him, the sheets over her face and then when he still didn't remove it, she reached over snd helped me remove it and kept it at least off my face until he put it on the bed itself. my body was still in shock from the injury and I could not stop shaking. As I asked for another blanket to warm me up he told me I didn't need any more since I already had 3 and that I could have hyperthermia and he couldn't give me another one. I don't know who the woman was in the room, but she brought me another one that was a warm blanket and was the only one that was kind with her words of comfort and actions as she covered me saying and telling me even how cold I was and that this heated blanket will help. I lost a lot of blood that night from my head injury.

The lack of communication was not their fault, and they appeared extremely calm and professional as a team throughout the most hectic of times. I never received the name of my nurse. In fact, I called out as someone passed my door about 50 minutes after shift change to ask if the previous nurses who started my IV had gone for the day, to which she replied, ""I'm your nurse now. What do you need?"" No further introduction or questions were asked by her for roughly 5 hours, and except for a few rounds of meds, the only communication we had was in the form of her telling me to sit down and to not rip my IV out. I previously worked in the emergency department of a nearby level 3 trauma center, so I am no stranger to how all of it works.

Yet he looked like a fool because all toxicology was clean, as I had adamantly tried to tell him. Once he got his result and was proved wrong he never returned and had some other doctor come in with absolutely zero knowledge of why I was there and instead of examining me, talking to me, and seeing if he had any better ideas he coped an attitude and said he wasn't treating anything at all and he was discharging me. With diabetic crisis and numerous shots of insulin taken on my own, 10 bottles of water, and phenergan to prevent vomiting, I was still in diabetic crisis while in the ER. The fluid given was less than a quarter of a bag and when I left my blood sugar was still over 600 which is highly unacceptable and dangerous. They didn't tell me about the hemangioma in my liver and an enlarged liver, despite the fact that I communicated severe pain in the upper right quadrant radiating into my kidney, along with severe abdominal contractions, black oily stool, and extreme fatigue and memory loss. Even with my mom their trying to communicate where I was failing they treated her disrespectfully and made outlandish assumptions about me and my mother.

Came to [person_name] CC abdominal pain; MD spoke to me about my symptoms and conducted a verbal assessment, but never an actual physical assessment (ie. palpated/felt my abdomen). This is okay, as MD proceeds to order appropriate testing/scans; however, after tests are resulted, MD makes diagnosis that (I feel) is premature. I was diagnosed with a UTI, due to what I'm assuming is the presence of blood and a *trace amount of bacteria in my urine; however, I had no complaints that matched the diagnosis, aside from abdominal pain. Based off my WBC from the CBC, I think infection wasn't incorrect, I just don't think it was urinary, and treating me for such, just because we didn't find anything else on the CT, was inappropriate. I was still feeling very sick when I left the ED (which I voiced to the discharging MD), and have had zero symptom improvement even after 4 days. I think the MD should have done a repeat urinalysis, due to the margin of error that is common for presence of bacteria, to see if it was actually in my urine or just a ""bad catch"". .For reference, 6 hours later I went to urgent care, due to a continual aggravation of my symptoms, and the urinalysis that they performed revealed no UTI.",unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,2

Your medical professionals couldn't understand that I was in pain, uncomfortable, and completely stressed and fatigued. Your employees didn't have enough empathy to understand that the stress I was being put under, during a MS relapse, was excruciating for me. I felt like I was being kidnapped and forced to do something I felt was unnecessary, useless, and exactly what my daughter wanted them to do and therefore, encouragement to continue to use the lack of mental health resources in SC, as a way to get unnecessarily admitted to a mental hospital. How many times a year does she have to be admitted and held just to come home with new and improved ways to scare anybody into sending her to the hospital where she comes home with new symptoms such as cutting. My daughter didn't cut herself until she made friends with another girl in the hospital, that was a cutter. Thanks for forcing me to continuously send my daughter to hospitals that are completely useless and only manage to make matters worse. How many times does this have to go on before somebody realizes they need to listen to her only parent? Someone at your hospital reported me to DSS because I didn't want my daughter to go back to SC's pipeline to prison. If any of you knew what goes on in those places you wouldn't want your daughter going there either. Someone from your staff lied to DSS and told them that I was threatening to leave and take my daughter with me. And yet I stayed with my daughter until after nine PM when I could take no more stress and pain and had to go home and leave my daughter with the sitter. I believe I was in the ER for eight hours that day. My daughter had, shortly after getting to the ER, decided that she no longer wanted to commit suicide and wanted to go home. But your employees thought to report me to DSS and for what??? If I were going to leave and take my daughter with me, I wouldn't have told them I was going to do it. I did say we were ready to go at one point but that was at a time that we thought the doctor was going to send her home since she was saying that she didn't want to hurt herself anymore. I did say I was going to leave, but I didn't mention or threaten to take my daughter. I stayed with my daughter until after 9 pm and my daughter was asleep and had a sitter. Why your staff would waste tax dollars for absolutely nothing is beyond me. Maybe your ER department could use some extra instruction on empathy, especially for sick people. I can't imagine how awful sick patients must be treated under your care.",unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,

1643,"I am answering on behalf of my aunt [person_name] [person_name] as her guardian and conservator. She was having issues at her memory care and was sent there to be sure something new wasn't going on like an infection, since she has been prone to UTIs and other things in the past. There were no tests performed on her and when I questioned it when I was called by medical staff, I was told she was not experiencing an emergency. She can be difficult in her current state but what she was experiencing was different even for her,  and should have been evaluated instead of being dismissed without receiving basic care and testing.",unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,communication_staff,resources_caring,2
